# fevertokens-tech-test

hello sir , i hope you are fine . To initiate my project setup, I began by enabling corepack in my development environment. This was achieved by executing the command corepack enable. Following this, I ensured that pnpm, a package manager for JavaScript projects, was up-to-date and activated across my workspace with corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate.

Next, I cloned the repository "FEVERTOKENS-TECH-TEST" to my computer, where I proceeded to create a new project directory named "coincatalog" with the $ pnpm create next-app coincatalog command. Within this directory, I initiated the installation of project dependencies by running pnpm install. Once all dependencies were successfully installed, I proceeded to build the project using pnpm run build to prepare it for deployment.

This structured approach not only ensured a streamlined setup of my development environment but also facilitated efficient management of dependencies and project compilation, laying a solid foundation for subsequent development and deployment phases.

in this illustration i will explain in my point of view how to find the broken car in the fastest way possible , as the illustratin shows i proposed firstly that the car drive straight we can call the distance drove by the car x . after the car drove the distance x . the driver should go back 2 times the distance x drove by the car so he can travel the same distances . With this method the car should go back and forth with the same distances drove by driver until he finds his friend

```
